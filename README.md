# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular accommodation rental platform, Airbnb. It is designed to demonstrate a full-stack web development workflow, covering front-end, back-end, and database integration.

The goal is to recreate the core features of Airbnb including:
- User authentication and registration
- Property listing and booking
- Search and filter functionality
- Responsive user interface

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vanilla JS)
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (or Node.js)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: Render, Netlify, or Heroku

## Project Goals
- Practice modular code design
- Understand full-stack architecture
- Deploy a production-ready clone application

## Team Roles

To build a full-featured Airbnb clone, the project team may consist of the following key roles. Each team member is responsible for specific components to ensure efficient collaboration and quality output.

### 👩‍💻 Frontend Developer
Responsible for building the user interface of the application. This includes implementing responsive designs, building interactive components, and ensuring a seamless user experience across devices using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks like React.

### 🧑‍💼 Backend Developer
Builds and maintains the server-side logic, APIs, and application architecture. Responsible for implementing core features such as authentication, booking logic, and communication with the database. Technologies used may include Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database schema. Ensures efficient data storage, indexing, backups, and security. The DBA collaborates closely with backend developers to optimize queries and data integrity for listings, users, and bookings.

### 🔒 DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure. Ensures that the application is reliably deployed, scalable, and secure on platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Render.

### 🧪 QA Engineer (Tester)
Ensures the product is reliable and bug-free. Writes test cases, performs automated and manual testing, and verifies features like booking flows, form validation, and login mechanisms function correctly.

### 🎨 UI/UX Designer
Designs the visual layout and user flow. Ensures that the app looks appealing, intuitive, and accessible. Creates wireframes, prototypes, and user journeys to guide frontend developers.

### 📋 Project Manager
Oversees project timelines, team coordination, and task prioritization. Ensures that the team meets deadlines, communicates effectively, and aligns with the project’s goals and milestones.
